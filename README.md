# This Repository Is Archived

Due to the movement away from OpenZWave in Home Assistant in favor of the more functional and less-fiddly ZWaveJS2MQTT,
these sets of helpers are no longer maintained and are, arguably, unnecessary. All of the functionality included herein
is far easier to accomplish via a NodeRed integration or with internal Home Assistant automation tools.
